# ecoinfo
*Assorted Tools for the Management and Analysis of Ecological Information*

This package contains assorted tools to facilitate the management and analysis of ecological information.  Current functions focus on tools for spatial analysis and statistics.  The spatial functions need to be updated to use modern R-spatial packages (i.e., `sf` and `terra`).  See Issues [#4](/../../issues/4) for more info.


**To install and load `ecoinfo` in R, run the following (requires the devtools package):**
```
devtools::install_github("jcarlis3/ecoinfo@master")
require(ecoinfo)
```
