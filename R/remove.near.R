#' Remove spatial points based on proximity
#'
#' This function removes points from a set (pts) based on a user-defined proximity rule.
#' It discards points that are within a specified distance of another point
#' in the set. It's important to note that this function is not optimized, 
#' meaning it may not remove points in the most efficient order, 
#' potentially resulting in a higher number of points being removed.
#'
#' @param pts sf data frame, the input points to thin based on proximity.
#' @param dist Scalar, the minimum distance features in pts can be from each other.  Unit is meters for projected coordinate systems.
#' @return A sf spatial object with equal or fewer features than pts.
